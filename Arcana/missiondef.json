I know it sounds crazy, but there might be something in what I recall that we could investigate.",
      "accepted": "Thank you.  Thing is, some of the scenery from these dreams looked familiar, and after zero day I started poring over some local maps to try and make sense of what little looked real.  One of the places I recall was hidden away in a part of the local woods I used to go camping in.

I'll let you decide what to do if we meet anyone here, I don't know if the other dreams will do us much good.
