Thing is, some of the scenery from these dreams looked familiar, and after zero day I started poring over some local maps to try and make sense of what little looked real.

Use summoning rites only when it is a necessary infliction to make on The Veil, and do not let the allure of blood magic cause yourself undue harm.

I have occasionally visited the refugee center to trade for essential tools and supplies, but I will be needed here for the time being, and the others have been busy gathering supplies and continuing construction.  We have arrangements made for delivery of supplies, but every so often we have to send inventory of what we need and what we have to offer.  Could you simply deliver this to their merchant, and return the receipt they usually write up?",
      "accepted": "Thank you.  The merchant requires an advance payment, usually surplus scavenged supplies or precious metals.  This should be sufficient to complete the arrangement, we use these to set aside measured amounts of material for repairing our equipment.  With your help we'll be able to focus our efforts on making this place livable, and once the trade is settled that'll give us more breathing room.  Hopefully by the time supplies start running low again, we'll have a few more of us around to take care of ourselves.",
