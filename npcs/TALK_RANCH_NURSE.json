A few days ago one of the scavengers came in with a severe injury, described a strange creature that attacked him while on his way to rendezvous with a few others.  I can relay where it happened I guess.  Very odd too, a three-inch section of his forearm suffered from fourth-degree frostbite, down to the tendons, and both the radius and ulna had a complete transverse fracture in that area.  We had no choice but to amputate, I'm afraidâ€¦"
