Thing is, some of the scenery from these dreams looked familiar, and after zero day I started poring over some local maps to try and make sense of what little looked real.

I have occasionally visited the local refugee center to trade for essential tools and supplies, but I will be needed here for the time being, and the others have been busy gathering supplies and continuing construction.  We have arrangements made for delivery of supplies, but every so often we have to send inventory of what we need and what we have to offer.  Could you simply deliver this to their merchant, and return the receipt they usually write up?",
      "accepted": "Thank you.  The merchant requires an advance payment, surplus scavenged supplies or precious metal.  This should be sufficient to complete the arrangement, we use these to set aside measured amounts of material for repairing our equipment.  With your help we'll be able to focus our efforts on making this place livable, and once the trade is settled that'll give us more breathing room.  Hopefully by the time supplies start running low again, we'll have a few more of us around to take care of ourselves.",

The handful of survivors to flee brought with them tales of living fire and otherworldly horror, warping the very stones underneath the sanctum.

They were able to seal it behind a barrier with one of our swords as the keystone, and you will need to undo the seal to confront it.  If you can retrieve that infernal weapon in your hunt, we will be able to destroy it safely.  I would commit a full hunting party if only we could spare anyone.  Dii vult!",
